# export-figma-designs-to-react-native
Contains a sample application, leveraging Figma and React Native, to test export libraries

## Getting Started
```
nvm install 21.0.0
nvm use 21.0.0
yarn create expo -t expo-template-blank-typescript
yarn expo install react-dom react-native-web @expo/webpack-config
yarn expo install @react-navigation/native
yarn expo install @react-navigation/native-stack
yarn expo install expo-image
yarn expo install react-native-screens
yarn expo install react-native-safe-area-context
```

## Testing the Locofy Plugin
- Uses the Mobile UI Template in Figma for a Delivery App

### Observations
- Does not provide code to install external libraries
- Must manually add pictures
- must debug errors
